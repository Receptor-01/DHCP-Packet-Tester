# DHCP (IPV4) Flooding Tool

## Overview

This is a DHCP flooding tool that generates and sends DHCP Discover packets at a high rate to test IPv4 network response and DHCP server behavior. This tool lets you analyze how their network handles large volumes of DHCP requests.


## Features

- Multi-threaded performance: Utilizes multiple CPU cores to send packets efficiently.

- Random MAC address generation: Ensures each packet appears unique.

- UDP Broadcast Mode: Sends packets to the network's broadcast address.

- Real-time Packet Rate Display: Shows packets sent per second.

- Graceful Shutdown: Stops execution cleanly upon user input.


## Requirements

- Operating System

- Linux (Tested on Ubuntu, Debian, and Kali Linux)

- macOS


## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed before running the script:

- GCC/G++ Compiler (for compiling C++ code)

- Make (optional, for managing builds)


## Installation & Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/DHCP-Flooder.git
cd DHCP-Flooder

### Step 2: Compile the Code

Use the g++ compiler to compile the C++ source code:

g++ -o dhcp_flood dhcp_flood.cpp -lpthread

### Step 3: Run the DHCP Flooder

To execute the script, use:

sudo ./dhcp_flood

Note: This script requires sudo because it uses raw sockets and sends broadcast packets.

### Step 4: Monitor Performance

Once the script starts running, it will display real-time performance statistics:

Packets sent: 100000, Rate: 5000.00 pps, Avg: 4800.00 pps
Packets sent: 200000, Rate: 5100.00 pps, Avg: 4950.00 pps

Press Enter to stop the execution gracefully.



## How It Works

The script initializes a pool of DHCP Discover packets.

Multiple threads send packets using UDP broadcasts to the DHCP server on port 67.

The program tracks the packet transmission rate and displays it to the user.

Pressing Enter stops the execution cleanly.

Network Testing & Usage Scenarios

Ensure your network allows broadcast traffic. Some routers and firewalls block broadcast packets by default.


## Use Cases:

Stress testing DHCP servers: You can evaluate how well a DHCP server handles large-scale DHCP requests.

Network monitoring: Detect network bottlenecks or limitations.

Security auditing: Detect DHCP starvation vulnerabilities and rogue DHCP servers.
